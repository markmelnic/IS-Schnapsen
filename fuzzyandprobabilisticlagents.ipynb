One reason for this is that our probabilistic strategy has a serious flaw: the Aces and 10s have a high probability of not having a higher card of the same suit, so that our strategy will pick valuable cards in phase 1. This is a high-gain, but also a high-risk strategy, as a reasonably good opponent would trump those cards and win valuable points. \n",
